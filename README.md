# Local Automatic Times Updater for MKW
A local CLI Tool that replaces the [old extension](https://github.com/FallBackITA27/Auto-Updater-MKL-MKWPP).
All the instructions are available in the executable. Remember to run it in a terminal!

## Build Instructions
You can discard the /json/ folder.

It's not necessary, the program fetches those resources on its own.

Just run `cargo build --release`.
